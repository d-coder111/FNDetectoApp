This is a simple Fake News Detection Web App built using python and flask and is deployed using microsoft azure.

**For instance consider the given statement-**

***Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so.”***

FNDetecto App will mark it as spam.

And now consider another statement-

***The Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted, and lifted in a timely way, which gives less encouragement to Iran***


FNDetecto App will detect it as real news.

## The primary objective is to identify the authenticity of the news and categorise it into fake and real news. In this project, Machine Learning model is leveraged to distinguish real and fake news and it has achieved an accuracy of 93.13%.
